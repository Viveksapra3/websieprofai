          These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern the use of Professor AI (“Platform”), an artificial 
          intelligence–powered teaching, mentoring, and examination system provided by 
          [Your Company Name] (“We,” “Us,” “Our”). By accessing or using the Platform, you 
          (“the User”) agree to these Terms. Please read them carefully before engaging

          </p>

          <h3>1. Purpose of the Platform</h3>
          <p>
          Professor AI is an educational technology solution designed to deliver interactive 
          teaching, provide mentoring and academic guidance, and conduct practice examinations 
          and assessments. The Platform is an AI-based system and is not a substitute for human 
          teachers, university faculty, or statutory examination boards. While we strive to ensure 
          accuracy, Professor AI may generate content that is incomplete, outdated, or incorrect. 
          Users must exercise discretion and verify any academic advice, results, or outputs with 
          qualified professionals or recognized institutions.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Disclaimer of Liability</h3>
          <p>
          We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the Platform 
          for a specific purpose, and the Platform is provided on an “as is” and “as available” 
          basis. To the extent permitted under Indian law, we disclaim all liability for direct, 
          indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of Professor AI. 
          Our maximum liability, if established by a competent court, shall not exceed the 
          subscription fees (if any) paid by the User in the preceding six months.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
          <p>
          These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India, and the

          Professor AI is intended only as a supplementary tool for learning, mentoring, and practice 
          examinations. It does not replace accredited teachers, universities, or statutory 
          examination authorities in India. Marks, scores, or assessments generated by Professor AI

          authority for curriculum design, grading, and certification.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Data Protection and Privacy</h3>
